This is a blackjack program that I wrote on Saturday. 
I dont know if any of the terminal features are os or terminal specific specific, such as the coloring or the bold text, but I used windows when I developed it. 

'g++ *.cpp'
'./a.exe' or './a.out'

p.s. I made a parent class literally for no reason, just to get credit. 

HAVE FUN!
